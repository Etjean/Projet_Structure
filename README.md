# Projet de bioinformatique structurale
Analysis of the protein **O00476**.

## Models Generation
- [ ] Secondary structure prediction (PSIPRED, CONCORD)
- [ ] Detection of transmembrane segments (TOPCONS)
- [ ] **Single-Alignement for homology modelling** (EMBOSS Water, Swiss-model)
- [ ] **Single-Template homology modelling** (Swiss-model, MODELER, Memoir for transmembrane protein)
- [ ] Multiple-Alignement + Multiple-Template homology modelling ?
- [ ] Evaluation of the model (ProQ)
- [ ] Model refinement, especially loops and side-chains refinement (ModRefiner, SuperLooper, FalcLoop, Galaxy Refine, Scwrl4, SidePro, Rasp)
- [ ] Embedding model in a membrane (PPM server)
- [ ] Generation of several states. Since it is a transporter, it should have at least two open & close conformations, or inward open & outward open conformations

## Conformations study
- [ ] Normal modes analysis (NOMAD, WebNMA)
- [ ] MD coarse grain (OpenMM, Gromacs, with Martini force field)

## Ligand study
- [ ] Docking (AutoDock ?)
