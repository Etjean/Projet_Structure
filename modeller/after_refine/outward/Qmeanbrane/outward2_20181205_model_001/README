Structure of a project
======================

The QMEAN project is composed of following files:

├── MODELNAME_MODELID
    ├── global_scores.txt
        * Global scores calculated by the QMEAN scoring function
    ├── local_scores.txt
        * Local scores calculated by the QMEAN scoring function
    ├── MODELNAME.pdb
        * Originally uploaded structure.
    ├── MODELID_raw.pdb
        * Raw model used for calculations - invalid residues, ligands were
          stripped off.
    ├── MODELID_processed.pdb
        * Model processed for the calculation and visualization purposes. In
          particular, this model is renumbered according to the SEQRES (ATOMSEQ
          if SEQRES is not given as an input).
    └── plots
        ├── CHAINNAME_disco.png - only for QMEANDisCo
            * Compares local QMEAN scores with local DisCo scores and the
              resulting QMEANDisCo scores for given CHAINNAME. Depending on the
              situation of found homologues, DisCo is not necessarlity defined
              everywhere.
        ├── local_quality_estimate_CHAINNAME.png
            * Local scores for given CHAINNAME.
        ├── local_quality_estimate.png
            * Compares local scores between chains.
        ├── model.png
            * Thumbnail of model colored by local score.
        ├── qmean4.png
            * Visualization of Z-scores for QMEAN4 global score and all its
              contributors.
        ├── qmean6.png
            * Visualization of Z-scores for QMEAN6 global score and all its
              contributors.
        └── reference_set.png
            * Relates QMEAN4 global score of particular model to what we would
              expect from high resolution X-ray structures of similar size.
        ├── qmean6_reference_set.png
            * Relates QMEAN6 global score of particular model to what we would
              expect from high resolution X-ray structures of similar size.
        ├── energy_gap.png - only for QMEANBrane
            * In the process of calculating the QMEANBrane scores, the membrane
              gets detected using a pseudo energy function representing an
              implicit solvation model.Relates the resulting energy with what
              we would expect from a typical membrane protein.
├── project.json
        * Internal parameters of the project.
        
MODELNAME - The original name of the file uploaded.
MODELID   - ID of the model assigned by QMEAN web server.
CHAINNAME - Name of the chain eg. A. If for any reason there is no chain name
            provided in the original file, the name will be set up
            automatically.
